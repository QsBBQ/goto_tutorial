MY SPOUSE WAS TERRIFIED BY THE EXPERIENCE BUT, FORTUNATELY,  SHE WAS NOT PHYSICALLY INJURED.  I HAD TO CALL AAA TO COME WITH A TOW TRUCK.

I AM WRITING TO COMPLAIN ABOUT A BIGGER ISSUE REGARDING \"DESIGN NEGLIGENCE\" BY MAZDA AS IT RELATES TO THE PLACEMENT OF THE POWER STEERING PUMP ON THIS 2008-3.  YOU SEE, THE PUMP (AN ITEGRAL PART OF THE STEERING AND VEHICLE SAFETY CONTROL SYSTEM) IS MOUNTED OUTSIDE THE CAR\\'S FRAME, JUST FORWARD OF THE PASSENGER FRONT TIRE.  IT IS BASICALLY JUST BEHIND THE PASSENGER HEADLIGHT/FOGLIGHT/BUMPER/QUARTER PANEL ASSEMBLY.  THIS LOCATION MAKES IT VERY SUSCEPTIBLE TO DAMAGE IN EVEN MINOR ACCIDENTS, RENDERING THE VEHICLE UNCONTROLLABLE AND UNSAFE IN THE VERY INSTANT WHERE CONTROL AND MANEUVERABILITY MAY KEEP OTHERS FROM BEING INJURED OR KILLED.  WHAT BROUGHT THIS TO MY ATTENTION WAS WHEN A DEER RECENTLY RAN INTO THIS VERY LOCATION AND RENDERED THE VEHICLE UNCONTROLLABLE AND THEREFORE UNDRIVABLE.  MY DAUGHTER (WHO SUSTAINED A CONCUSSION) WAS DRIVING THE CAR AT THE TIME AND WAS VERY SHOCKED AND SURPRISED  THAT EVEN THOUGH THE CAR WAS TECHNICALLY DRIVABLE (MINUS QUARTER PANEL, LEADLIGHT/FOGLIGHT AND PART OF THE BUMPER COVER) SHE COULD NOT PHYSICALLY STEER THE CAR.  IN ADDITION, THE OFFICER WRITING UP THE ACCIDENT REPORT TRIED TO MANEUVER THE CAR OFF OF THE ROAD TO A SAFER LOCATION AND WAS ALSO UNABLE TO PHYSICALLY STEER THE CAR.  THERE WAS NOTHING OBSTRUCTING THE TURNING OF THE WHEEL IN EITHER DIRECTION.  I WOULD HATE TO THINK WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IF THIS ACCIDENT OCCURRED AT A HIGHER SPEED AND ON A BUSIER ROADWAY OR HIGHWAY.  THIS TYPE OF PUBLIC HEALTH SAFETY AND WELFARE ISSUE NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED AND PROSECUTED.

THESE ISSUES ARE: 1) BAD SMELLING FUMES ENTERING THE CABIN OF THE VEHICLE WHEN THE AIR IS ON IN ANY MODE SETTING SUCH AS THE WINDSHIELD OR BASE MODE. THE FUMES SMELL SO TOXIC THAT SOMETIMES IT RESULTS IN NAUSEA AND HEADACHES. YOU HAVE TO TURN OFF THE AIR AND PUT DOWN ALL THE WINDOWS TO AIR OUT ALL THE FUMES IN THE CAR. THE SMELL COMES AND GOES AND USUALLY HAPPENS WHEN THE CAR HAS BEEN DRIVEN FOR OVER 20-30 MINUTES WITH THE AIR OR HEAT ON. THE DEALER QUICKLY FOUND THE ISSUE AND GAVE ME A DIAGNOSIS. THERE WAS A LEAK AND THEY EVEN SHOWED ME WHERE THE LEAK WAS COMING FROM.  THE LEAK WAS BURNING INTO THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD AND CREATED HARMFUL FUMES WHICH WAS GOING INTO THE CABIN OF THE VEHICLE. I LEFT THE VEHICLE AT THE DEALER BECAUSE IT WAS NOT HEALTHY TO DRIVE IT, ESPECIALLY SINCE I DID NOT WANT MY FAMILY GOING INTO THE CAR; ESPECIALLY MY NEW BORN AND BEING EXPOSED TO POTENTIAL NAUSEA, HEADACHES OR ANY ILLNESSES.

WEATHER WAS CLEAR, TEMPERATURE WAS IN THE MID 50S.  NO IMPACT TO THE VEHICLE OCCURRED.   THE SUNROOF ON MY VEHICLE SPONTANEOUSLY SHATTERED AND EXPLODED SENDING GLASS THROUGHOUT THE INTERIOR OF THE CAR.   FURTHER, WHILE CLEANING UP THE GLASS MANY OF THE PIECES WERE SHARP AND GLASS SPLINTERS WERE PREVALENT.  THERE WERE NUMEROUS NICKS AND CUTS ON MY HANDS AND MY SON'S HANDS FROM CLEANING UP THE GLASS WHICH WAS EVERYWHERE.    IF ANYONE HAD BEEN IN THE BACK SEAT OF THE CAR (PARTICULARLY A CHILD), THEY COULD HAVE BEEN SERIOUSLY HURT.     MY SON WITNESSED THIS AS WELL - HE WAS SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT.  AGAIN, BOTH OF US CAN CONFIRM THAT THERE WERE NO VEHICLES IN FRONT OR TO THE SIDE OF US AND NOTHING HAPPENED (SUCH AS A ROCK FROM A VEHICLE IN FRONT) THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSED THE SUNROOF TO SHATTER.   FURTHER, THE FACT THAT IT SHATTERED THE WAY IT DID WITH SHARP GLASS AND SPLINTERING THROUGHOUT THE CAR IS PROBLEMATIC.    I HAVE TRIED TO ADDRESS THIS MATTER WITH HONDA TO NO AVAIL.    I CONSIDER THIS A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY ISSUE.  A SUNROOF SHOULD NEVER EXPLODE IN THIS MATTER ABSENT A MANUFACTURING DEFECT.   MORE IMPORTANTLY, HAD THOSE SMALL, SHARP SHARDS OF GLASS AND SPLINTERS HIT SOMEONE'S EYES IN THE BACKSEAT OF THE CAR, IT COULD HAVE RESULTED A VERY SERIOUS INJURY.
